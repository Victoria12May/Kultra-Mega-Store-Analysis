# ‚úÖ Observation:

The analysis reveals how shipping costs vary across different combinations of Order Priority and Ship Mode.

Higher-priority orders (e.g., Critical, High) tend to use faster and more expensive shipping methods like Express Air, which drives up the average shipping cost.

Conversely, Delivery Truck and Regular Air are generally used for lower-priority or standard orders, resulting in lower average costs,

# ‚úÖ Consolidated Recommendations for Management

***1. Align Shipping Method with Order Priority:***

- Reserve high-cost shipping options like Express Air for high-priority orders (Critical, High).

- Encourage the use of economical options like Delivery Truck for low-priority or standard orders to reduce logistics expenses.

***2. Optimize Shipping Cost Strategy:***

- Periodically review shipping cost data to ensure cost-efficiency.

- Negotiate better rates with shipping providers based on volume and usage patterns.

***3. Improve Sales in Low-Performing Regions:***

- Conduct targeted marketing campaigns and customer outreach in the bottom 3 sales regions.

- Assess potential barriers such as supply chain issues, product fit, or customer accessibility in those areas.

***4. Strengthen Top-Performing Regions:***

- Reinforce efforts in the top-performing regions through loyalty programs, upselling, and personalized engagement.

- Use these regions as benchmarks to replicate successful strategies in weaker markets.

***5. Data Monitoring and Continuous Review:***

- Implement regular dashboards and reports to track trends in sales, shipping costs, and order priority behavior.

- Use insights to make agile decisions that balance cost savings with service quality.
